# AboutTara-bootstrap

This site is to showcase a responsive site. The goal is to utilise Twitter Bootstrap and its grid to modify https://taradm23.github.io/AboutTara/.

## Language used
This site is built with HTML. Styling is done using CSS and Twitter Bootstrap.
The user experience and layout was made to follow a design submitted by the lecture.

## Testing
To check the sites responsivness over diffrent screens I used Chrom inspects toggle device toolbar.
Additionally https://validator.w3.org/ was used to validate the HTML.
