                <p>Hi - Hola - Sup - Mahalo - Kia Ora - YI'el !!! Welcome to a site dedicated to ME!!!
                    Whhhhhaaaaaa??? Yes you read that right!!! We had to make this site after learning bootstrap and
                    combine it to a past class assignment.
                    Even though the UI was not diffent the approach did involve a lot of big changes. But I digress - -
                    -
                    Who am I? Lets start with where I'm from - Melboure, Australia, Earth, Solar System, Orion
                    Spiral Arm, Milky Way Galaxy, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Universe. Which is pretty cool and
                    accurate directions if you're an alien! I love both cats AND dogs. I'm super blind but that's fine I
                    have glasses!I like to read - J. R. R.
                    Tolkin, J. K. Rowling and Rick Riordan are some of my favourite authors. I love comics; Kamala Khan
                    as Ms Marvel is my favourite.
                    I also collect Funko Pops! On top of that I love sci-fi and comedy and anime TV shows. For example
                    New Girl, Parks and
                    Recreation, Full Metal Alchemish, Firefly and Buffy. I'm currently watching RWBY by Rooster Teeth.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                <p>On a more serious note I have a B.Comm from the University of Melbourne. I have experience as a
                    Product
                    Manager at a software company. I'm also a certified Scrum Product Owner. So here I am. There
                    isnt
                    much
                    to go on this site yet. But this is an outcome from two weeks of coading background.
                    There's only up from here.
