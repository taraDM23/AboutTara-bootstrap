                <p>Hi - Hola - Sup - Mahalo - Kia Ora - YI'el !!! Welcome to a site dedicated to ME!!! Whhhhhaaaaaa???
                    Yes
                    you read
                    that right!!!
                    We had to make this site after learning html and css as a class assignment. It's pretty imersive and
                    frankly I found out many
                    ways to reach from point A to point B. That being said part of the challenge is to develope code
                    that
                    will
                    withstand time and pass peer review!

                    But I digress - - -
                </p>
                <p> Who am I? Lets start with where I'm from - Melboure, Australia, Earth, Solar System, Orion Spiral
                    Arm,
                    Milky Way Galaxy, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Universe. Which is pretty cool and accurate
                    directions if you're an alien! I love both cats AND dogs. I'm super blind but that's fine I have
                    glasses!
                </p>
                <p>I like to read - J. R. R. Tolkin, J. K. Rowling and Rick Riordan are some of my favourite authors.
                    I love comics; Kamala Khan as Ms Marvel is my favourite. I also collect Funko Pops!
                    On top of that I love sci-fi and comedy and anime TV shows. For example New Girl, Parks and
                    Recreation,
                    Full
                    Metal Alchemish, Firefly and Buffy. I'm currently watching RWBY by Rooster Teeth.
                </p>
                <p>On a more serious note I have a B.Comm from the University of Melbourne. I have experience as a
                    Product
                    Manager at a software company. I'm also a certified Scrum Product Owner. So here I am. There isnt
                    much
                    to go on this site yet. But this is an outcome from two weeks of coading background.
                    There's only up from here.
                </p>
